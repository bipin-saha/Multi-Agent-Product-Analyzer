Grammarly has made me aware of mistakes that I have been making consistently and how to correct them. I've learned more than I ever thought I could from this experience!

I like the fact that Grammarly quickly identifies miss-spellings and lapses in sentence construction. What I don't like is the American spelling of such words as metre (meter), kilometre (kilometer), mineralise (mineralize) and many other words where a 'z' is substituted for an 's'. Many words in my geological professional writing have 'ise' endings and the dictionary won't allow the English spelling of such words, so I end up with a technical report full of red underlined words which is annoying.

Grammarly is straightforward to use. You can compose a letter without thinking about spelling or grammar, Grammarly will suggest corrections for you.

It was so easy to use and making things much more convenient to write a message or documentations. However, sometimes G becomes aggressive and tenacious which really upset me. I need to practice my own word of writing sometimes. Besides that G is good all the way.

We all speak English, but writing English to communicate your emotions and thoughts can be tricky sometimes. Grammarly comes in handy as it helps you improve your writeup to communicate well and always.

I want everything to be able to get fixed instead of only small mistakes I don't have the money to pay for Grammarly and there are a lot of other people that don't have money for it. I think if it can fix everything that will help a lot not only the stuff underlined in red but also the words underlined in blue and yellow.

I like that it helps to check spelling. I have severe RA, so I sometimes accidentally hit the wrong key and misspell a word. I am also a writer/published author, so I see that it helps with putting together sentences and punctuation.

The rephrasings proposed are improved versions of what I have written in almost all cases, and when they are not, it is because I meant something different.

I would rate the spelling correction 5/5 in a second, but, if everyone used grammerly, what would writing diversity be? It would all be the same and books would start sounding and looking more and more the same rather than interesting and different. So, I'm not exactly sure about all this yet.

My university's surprise decision to give me the 'green light' to use this tool means I can confidently use Grammarly without the added guilt of 'cheating.' There is no cheating. Grammarly helps you beautify and construct your sentences in a professional tone, saving time. Thank you for the 25% discount. I've decided to sign up today for a Pro subscription today.

I love this program ! I haven't been in school for many years and I can tell my grammar is not what it once was. Grammarly has saved me from embarrassing grammar blunders ! I'd recommend for anyone needing a brush-up on proper writing.

don't always agree with sentence structure... there is a certain way of speaking in my busines and grammerly will sometimes try to rearrange a sentence in a way that doesn't make sense... so i ignore those suggestions. Overall though, it has been great at catching typos and punctuation errors and pointing out potential ways to restructure a sentence.

They limit writers by not allowing A.I help on "sensitive content." If you are writing a book there will almost always be sensitive content. I am going to contact them on a refund. They charged me $60 on the same day I found out of this limitation from the trial. Just 100% facts. It's in their application, not to mention it doesn't work on all windows applications. You have to copy and paste into the website with certain applications you write in.

I was so grateful with Grammarly service!I forgot to cancel my 7-day trial on Grammarly and was so worried after reading the refund legacy of Grammarly. Despite holidays, I still receive fast reply on my problem report. The Grammarly Support team works fast and efficiently together. I feel caring and thankful for that. The Grammarly free 7-day trial was amazing as well. My cancelation is decided due to my financial ability, not the experience trying out the Grammarly Premium. If I have more report to be written in my next university years, I will definitely purchase one.I had the support when I was in the utmost need, checking my grammar mistakes and writing style for applying for my scholarship. Highly recommend trying out Grammarly for non-native speaker like me:333

I like that I can recommend Grammarly to my students. I have also recently used Grammarly to help me revise emails for parents to make them easier to translate into other languages. This feature of the AI is something I had not anticipated ever using, but it was immensely helpful.
