It\u2019s worked great for transcribing client meetings and internal discussions. With the features to store and share transcriptions with platforms such as Google Drive, it\u2019s easy to integrate with. If you attend live meetings or events the best part is the ability to transcribe in real time. Moreover, the AI itself gets better, so each transcription gets better and better as time progresses.

Essentially the system works fine, but sometimes when a long transcription job goes a little long the system will lag. I wish I could also customize more to get the outputs how I would like them. They work well, but they still miss context at times, especially with technical or domain specific words and you still need to edit them. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com."

I don\u2019t need to transcribe recordings manually anymore and I can focus on other important work. We\u2019ve streamlined our workflow, where my team instantly have access to accurate text from meetings and calls, allowing them to collaborate more efficiently and avoid the important details falling between the cracks.

It does well on quiet environments but the transcription quality falls when there is noise interference. And it sometimes misunderstands technical parlance, which I have to correct by default. It\u2019s not all bad though, it would simply be nice for customer support to be a little quicker because sometimes they take a while to respond to more complex questions.

They have shown stronger commitment with their latest TTS system called Aura which actually helps customers to stick to one company for both ASR and TTS. this is actually very helpful. They have lots of good documentation and this helps the developer community to get a quick start on their solutions. Ease of implementation starts with good documentation. Deepgram APIs and their simplistic approach towards the APIs even tho they are building complicated models to get state of the art Voice models actually makes it easy to use .
